    <h2>CYBERBULLYING</h2>
    <p>
        Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that occurs through digital platforms such as social media, text
        messaging, or online gaming. It involves using technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target
        individuals or groups. This type of bullying can manifest in various ways, including sending abusive
        messages, impersonating someone to harm their reputation, sharing private information without
        consent, excluding someone from online discussions, and publicly shaming victims by sharing
        humiliating content.
    </p>
    <p>
        The effects of cyberbullying can be severe, leading to anxiety, depression, and, in some cases, suicidal
        thoughts. Victims often experience feelings of isolation and powerlessness, exacerbating mental health
        issues. Studies indicate a significant link between cyberbullying and adverse psychological outcomes,
        highlighting the importance of awareness and proactive measures to combat this growing issue.
