    <h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
    <p>Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that occurs through digital platforms such as social media, text messaging, or online gaming. It involves using technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target individuals or groups. This type of bullying can manifest in various ways, including sending abusive messages, impersonating someone to harm their reputation, sharing private information without consent, excluding someone from online discussions, and publicly shaming victims by sharing humiliating content.

The effects of cyberbullying can be severe, leading to anxiety, depression, and, in some cases, suicidal thoughts. Victims often experience feelings of isolation and powerlessness, exacerbating mental health issues. Studies indicate a significant link between cyberbullying and adverse psychological outcomes, highlighting the importance of awareness and proactive measures to combat this growing issue. .</p>
