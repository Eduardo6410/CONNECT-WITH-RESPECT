        <h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
        <img class="img-banner" src="cyberbullying_image.jpg" alt="Cyberbullying Concept">
        <p>Cyberbullying refers to bullying that takes place over digital platforms such as social media, text messages, online forums, and gaming. It includes spreading false rumors, sending threatening or abusive messages, impersonating someone to damage their reputation, or publicly shaming individuals online.</p>
        <p>The impact of cyberbullying can be devastating. Victims may experience depression, anxiety, feelings of isolation, and in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. It's crucial to educate ourselves and others about how to identify and address cyberbullying. Here are some key signs of cyberbullying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frequent withdrawal from online interactions.</li>
            <li>Unexplained injuries or stress related to online activities.</li>
            <li>Sudden decline in self-esteem or mood changes.</li>
            <li>Being reluctant to go to school or other social events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to intervene as soon as you recognize the signs of cyberbullying. Speak to trusted individuals, block the bully, and report the issue to authorities when necessary.</p>
